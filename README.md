# RagaDetector
Raga detection using autocorrelation function
This is a project based on determining the frequency of sound using the autocorrelation function.
Each raga may contain 5-7 notes which are made up of frequency.
The raga database is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Janya_ragas.
